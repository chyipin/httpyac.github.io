# Contributing to httpyac.github.io

From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is appreciated and welcome.

## Issues

If you just want some help or a detail question, please post
a question to [vscode-httpyac - Discussions](https://github.com/AnWeber/vscode-httpyac/discussions/new). Questions
that include an example and/ or the full error message are more likely to receive responses.

**If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/AnWeber/httpyac/issues/new).**

## Submitting Changes

After getting some feedback, push to your fork and submit a pull request. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives, but for small changes your pull request should be accepted quickly.
If there is no issue, an explanatory comment would be helpful.

## Development Setup

This project uses [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm v7 for development. As development editor I recommend VS Code

```sh
# install dependencies
npm i

# serve
npm run serve

```
